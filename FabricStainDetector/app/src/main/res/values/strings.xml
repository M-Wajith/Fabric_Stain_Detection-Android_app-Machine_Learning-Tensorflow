        Our project, developed as part of the IT41033 Nature-Inspired Algorithm course,is dedicated to fabric detection. Through our mobile application,
        users can effortlessly upload images via the camera or import them from files.
        Utilizing XML and Java for the mobile application, and Python for machine learning,
        our team, consisting of K.G.R.Mileesha (IT2020104), H.B.M.C.K.Bandara (IT2020031), I.M.Wajith (IT2020032), J.Mila Dilshika (IT2020053), and R.Dilani (IT2020040),
        has crafted an innovative solution for fabric analysis. Our app provides accurate stain detection of fabric,
        catering to both consumer and professional textile inspection needs,
        and exemplifying the application of advanced algorithms
        in real-world scenarios.</string>
